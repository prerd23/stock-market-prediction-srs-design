## 💡 Project Overview

The *Stock Prediction System* aims to assist users in forecasting stock prices based on historical data using analytical models. This repository covers the early **design phase** of the software development lifecycle — focusing on requirement documentation and UML-based system design.

## 🎯 Key Components

- **Functional Requirements** (e.g., user login, prediction output, stock selection)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (e.g., performance, availability, maintainability)
- **Actors**: End User, System, Admin (if any)
- **Use Cases**: View Prediction, Upload Dataset, Analyze Trend
- **Classes**: User, Stock, Predictor, DatabaseConnector, ReportGenerator

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Creating an IEEE SRS document
- Translating system requirements into UML diagrams
- Analyzing workflows and interactions in predictive systems
- Practicing documentation aligned with SDLC
